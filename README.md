# Systems Learning

This repository documents my journey into systems programming and backend engineering,
focusing on understanding how programs work at a low level.

I am a first-year Computer Science student studying in Hungary.
This repository contains hands-on projects written in C, with an emphasis on
memory management, concurrency, and performance.
